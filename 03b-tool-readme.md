# Introduction
+ Now lets implement whatever we have learnt till now by modifying the working of a tool to our purpose.

+ We are going to modify the working of a tool used in linux to calculate the number of lines, words, characters, or byte count of a file.

# What We Are Going To Do ?
+ This tool is very good except one thing! The output it displays is pretty confusing to me. 
+ Whether you pass any option, it is always going to give you a integer number. It is possible in hurry that we forget what we asked for and we substituted the wrong value in our work. This might be troublesome.
+ And this is exactly what we are going to solve.
+ We are going to utilise a command called `wc` , and modify its output to resolve this exact thing.
